# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and Tkinter. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. The game displays a message when a player wins and disables further moves.

## Features
- **Two Player Mode**: Players take turns playing as 'X' or 'O'.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects when a player has won by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Game Over**: Once a winner is detected, all buttons are disabled to prevent further moves.
- **Error Handling**: Displays a message if a player tries to click an already selected box.
